    <p>
      <span>If I could say</span><span>That I would take you away</span>
      <span>Would you come along with me?</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Where our music could play</span><span>Every day is our way</span>
      <span>Is it something you can see?</span>
    </p>
    <h3 class="album-lyrics-song-title">Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      <span>A reflection is where we see ourselves</span>
      <span>like others see us</span><span>Where we live to exist</span>
      <span>and observe that existence</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Paint your reflection in a ripple of the sea</span>
      <span>Look at yourself and know that this, yourself, is me</span>
      <span>Blessed and cursed by analytical potential</span>
      <span>Locked away for a lifetime, holding the key</span>
    </p>
    <p>&lt; solo section &gt;</p>
    <p>
      <span>A reflection shows what you are in you;</span>
      <span>The dark and light in you; the synergy.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>But when there's a conflict with our inner self truth</span>
      <span>When will we know that we have finally reached our goals?</span>
      <span>Paint your reflection in a ripple of the sea</span>
      <span>Paint your reflection in the sea</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>When your past comes back to haunt you</span>
      <span>It should remind you that you are free</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>(To face oneself after being distanced for so long</span>
      <span>There will be constants changing â€¦ definitely)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>(repeat)</span>
      <span>I'm holding back myself from my self</span>
    </p>
