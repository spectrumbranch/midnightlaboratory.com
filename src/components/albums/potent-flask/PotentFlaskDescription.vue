      This album is intended to be a progressive, mostly instrumental journey
      through a surreal, symbolic narrative inspired by thoughts and experiences
      I've had throughout my life. The ambiguity behind the track titles and
      melodic theme is intentional, in hopes that it will encourage the listener
      to apply their own mental imagery and meaning to the provided motifs and
      musical expressions.

      If someone is looking for a more concrete explanation, however, I have
      written a potential explication:
    </p>
    <div class="album-story-text">
      <p>
        In a semi-metaphysical realm of the mind, a young scientific individual
        learns how to develop new ideas in their laboratory. The euphoria of
        discovery crescendos briefly until it is tragically cut short by the
        Wobberjacky, a destructive force of unknowable motives and intentions.
        The Wobberjacky enters the lab on a path of annihilation, leading to the
        near extinction of the protagonist's creativity and inspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our protagonist narrowly escapes. From the remains of the laboratory,
        they formulate a solution and put it into a rather potent flask to
        combat their nightmarish foe. To the surprise of the protagonist,
        imbibing the contents of the flask instead causes a reality-altering
        psychedelic effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sobering up from the solution's psychedelic trip, the protagonist is
        left in a state of post-psychotic afterglow, where they exist in a
        short-lived peace before succumbing to the madness of the situation.
        Their body's natural response to this introverted anxiety is a
        mellifluous dreamlike state in which they face much of their
        subconscious, including a vision of a peaceful seaside and then a sudden
        growth of chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is from this chaos that the protagonist violently awakens into a
        harsh realization of what their life has become. They can run all they
        like, but the Wobberjacky will continue its pursuit unless they make
        real, impactful changes in their life.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, they focus on rebuilding. They project a reflection of themselves in
        a body of water, leading to a metaphysical self-analysis and the
        realization that dividing light and dark can lead to a fractured sense
        of self. The protagonist sees a duplicity in the choices they must make
        to find peace. They could enter the water and escape into a kind of
        peace or stand and fight the nightmarish Wobberjacky head-on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The listener is left to their own interpretation of the path to victory
        forged by the protagonist, as the end sees them finding themselves at
        the peaceful seaside after all.
