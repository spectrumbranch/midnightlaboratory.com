      The goal behind the creation of Anamnesis was to create a melancholy noir
      jazz track, as if it felt like it was raining outside. A soft synth lead
      was used with the intent of adding an eerie feel. The track is used in the
      video game DELUGE mostly during flashback moments of the protagonist's
      life.
